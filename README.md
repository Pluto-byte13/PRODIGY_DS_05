US TRAFFIC ACCIDENT ANALYSIS:

This project involves exploratory data analysis of a large dataset containing traffic accident records across the United States. The goal is to uncover patterns based on weather, road conditions, time of day, and visualize accident hotspots.

OBJECTIVE:

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

KEY INSIGHTS:

• Accident Hotspots: Interactive heatmaps showing dense accident locations across the US.
• Weather Conditions: Distribution of accidents under different weather scenarios.
• Visibility Impact: Accidents grouped by visibility levels (in miles).
• Time Trends: Accident frequency by hour of day.
• Interactive Geo Charts: Using folium and plotly for spatial visualizations.

DATASET:

• Source: Kaggle - US Accidents (Sobhan Moosavi)

• Size: ~7 million accident records
• Columns: Location, weather, visibility, severity, timestamp, etc.
• File used: US_Accidents_Dec21_updated.csv

TOOLS & LIBRARIES:

• Python
• Pandas, NumPy
• Matplotlib, Seaborn
• Folium – for geographic heatmaps
